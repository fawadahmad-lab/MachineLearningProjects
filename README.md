### 🧠 Machine Learning Internship - Intern Intelligence (4 Weeks)  

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Internship** repository at **Intern Intelligence**! This repository contains my work during the **4-week internship**, where I explore and implement various **ML and DL** concepts through hands-on projects.  

## 🚀 Internship Overview  

During this internship, I will be working on **five key projects**, each focusing on a different aspect of Machine Learning and Deep Learning:  

1️⃣ **Fine-Tuning ML Models** – Enhancing machine learning models using different techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and regularization.  
2️⃣ **Developing Deep Learning Models** – Building deep learning architectures using frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.  
3️⃣ **Transfer Learning** – Leveraging pre-trained models to improve performance on custom datasets.  
4️⃣ **Anomaly Detection** – Implementing techniques to detect rare patterns or outliers in datasets using ML and DL models.  
5️⃣ **End-to-End ML Pipeline** – Designing a complete ML workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.
